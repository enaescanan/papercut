                    <h2>As global demand for paper continually grows, natural forests and wildlife are becoming more and more vulnerable to unsustainable and illegal practices.</h2>
                    <p>Ideally, trees used for paper should come from sustainably managed forests or tree farms. But, as global consumption and demand for the product increase, unsustainable practices are being resorted to&mdash;degrading forests and threatening wildlife. Such practices also affect people who depend on the forests.</p>
                    <p>According to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, the remaining natural forests in Sumatra, Borneo, New Guinea, and the Russian Far East are endangered because of the growing demand for pulpwood, among other threats. The activities of the pulp and paper sector in these places threaten the habitats of several rare wildlife species such as Asian big cats, Asian elephants, Asian rhinos, and orangutans.</p>

                    <h2>Paper production requires huge amounts of natural resources like water and energy. It is also a large source of pollution: air, water, and solid waste.</h2>
                    <p>The main steps in paper production are: raw material preparation (wood debarking and chipping); wood pulping; pulp bleaching; and paper manufacturing. According to Gavrilescu et.al., each step in the process of paper production is a source of pollution in the form of air emissions, liquid effluents, and solid waste.</p>
                    <h6><strong class="f_bld">Water Pollution</strong><br/>Wastewater discharges from a pulp and paper mill contains solids, nutrients and dissolved organic matter. The direct discharge of mill effluents to the surrounding environment can negatively impact the surrounding ecosystems: it can cause eutrophication of fresh water bodies, and change the ecological characteristics of water, affecting the fish and aquatic insects.
                    </h6>
                    <h6><strong class="f_bld">Air Pollution</strong><br/>The industry is also a large source of standard air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxides, carbon monoxides and particulates, which contribute to ozone warnings, acid rain, and global warming.

                <h2>Paper in the landfill is a significant source of methane.</h2>
                <p>The fact that paper products have a heavy environmental cost is made worse by the significant percentage of paper that ends up in landfills even though they are completely recyclable. The decomposition of paper in landfills is among the most significant sources of landfill methane according to U.S. EPA. In addition, landfilling creates toxins, leachates, and greenhouse gases.</p>

                 <h2>In universities, where populations are beyond the thousands and where almost all classes have a form of paper requirement, paper consumption are likely to be high.</h2>
                <p class="psmall">
                The LS is no exception. In the LS Campus, an average of <strong class="f_bld">10,150 reams of white office paper</strong>, or roughly 21,782.2 kilograms, are purchased yearly by the Central Purchasing Office (CPO). The average amount of white paper that goes to the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) yearly is 1,410 kilograms, which is only <strong class="f_bld">6.47% </strong>of the total average of white office paper purchased by the CPO.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In addition to the white office paper purchased by the CPO, the Loyola Schools (LS) community also consumes a significant amount of white office paper through the different printing and photocopying centers. The LS currently has eight of these centers, in addition to the printing services of the New Rizal Library and Intermatrix. On average, the community consumes around <strong class="f_bld">50-100 reams of A4 paper per center per month</strong>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                That's a lot of paper.

                <h3 class="f_exbld">Efforts</h3>
                <h2>This paper consumption pattern is currently being addressed in two ways: paper segregation and diversion to the MRF, and enforcing policies to reduce paper consumption.</h2>
                <p class="psmall">
                <strong class="f_bld">The MRF and the Dry Paper Bin</strong>
                <br/>
                The MRF is the small building between Faura Hall and PIPAC. The solid waste we generate in campus and dispose of in the school's many bins is diverted to the MRF for further segregation and storage. The recyclables and dry paper are sold to accredited recyclers and the revenue is given to the maintenance staff bonus fund.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Dry Paper Bin is one of the five bins of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Scheme (ESWMS), where waste is diverted to either the campusâ€™ MRF, or the vermicomposting facility.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Dry Paper Bin works to divert <strong class="f_bld">clean and dry paper</strong> to the MRF for selling, instead of to the landfills.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong class="f_bld">Policies</strong>
                <br/>
                Aside from diverting paper from the landfills, the university also has policies in place to reduce paper consumption.
                <br/>
                <br/>
